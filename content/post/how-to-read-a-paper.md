Over the last five years I have had to read over probably close to two hundred academic papers for class, work, and research. Few papers are actually even read entirely. It is common for one to skim, get the gist, and move on. I've personally always found the format and tone used in academic papers poor at actually effectively conveying information to its readers. Especially in the increasing number of papers and information, it's senseless. Blog formats are far more engaging to readers and actually something people spend time reading.
