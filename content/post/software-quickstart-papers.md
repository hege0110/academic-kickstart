Worse is Better
http://www.mit.edu/~6.033/papers/Worse_is_Better.pdf
This philosophy serves as the backbone for software engineering. Itâ€™s more of a high level discussion than a technical paper per se but gets you into the software mindset. Every software engineer I've met knows this philosophy.

Unix Time-Sharing System
https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/cs262/unix.pdf
Understanding UNIX is to understand computers. Most computers are unix based, practically all servers are.  This is moderately technical, but almost completely abstracts away the complexity of the actual CPU underneath it.

World Wide Web
There are lot of lessons to learn within computers, but to fast forward to DNS (Domain Name Service) would help clarify the enigma that is the world wide web.

Assuming you have two computers that can talk to one another on the same network, how does that scale to every computer in the globe?


At this point, you get to two papers that become Hadoop and HDFS. https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf and http://web.mit.edu/6.033/www/papers/gfs-sosp2003.pdf
These are moderately technical papers. Though they give enough explanation to keep it grounded, and enough detail that understanding it will be an exercise.
