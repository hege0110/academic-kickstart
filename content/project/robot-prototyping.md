Although the decreasing cost of electronic hardware has made unmanned aerial vehicles an affordable platform for developing autonomous algorithms, there are still many challenges facing this area of research including planning, control, perception and learning. When designing software models that tackles these problems, it is necessary to test the model’s performance on live robotic hardware. Performing live tests are a key step in transitioning algorithms from software simulation to real-world systems. These tests are important in understanding how the algorithm performs in different tasks and reacts to various kinds of environmental noise. In general, when running algorithms on physical robotics systems, new challenges that are often unrelated to the primary goals of the investigation present themselves, including issues of hardware failure and noisy environments. When running algorithms on flying robots or quads, these issues are magnified with the added concern of unsafe failure modes. When a ground robot fails, at worst it collides with a wall or stubs someone’s toe. When a quad fails, spinning propellers in the air may potentially cause more damage. With these challenges, the overhead of creating new demonstrations are time consuming obstacles that are often burdensome to researchers.</p>
